# Book Management RESTful API

Description:

The Book Management RESTful API is a robust and user-friendly application designed for the efficient management of a collection of books. It leverages the power of Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and Lombok to provide a seamless and intuitive interface for performing essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on book records.

Key Features:

    Retrieve All Books: Users can easily retrieve a list of all books stored in the system by making a simple GET request to the /books endpoint.

    Create New Books: Adding new books to the collection is straightforward. Users can use the POST request with a JSON payload containing book details to the /books endpoint. Upon successful creation, the API responds with a status of "201 Created."

    Update Book Information: The API allows users to update the information of an existing book by specifying the book's ID in the PUT request to the /books/{id} endpoint. Users provide a JSON payload with the updated book details, and the API responds with a "200 OK" status.

    Delete Books: Removing books from the collection is also supported. Users can send a DELETE request to the /books/{id} endpoint, specifying the ID of the book to be deleted. A successful deletion results in a "204 No Content" response.

    Retrieve Books by Author: Users interested in books by a specific author can make use of the /books/booksByAuthor/{author} endpoint. It allows them to retrieve a list of books by specifying the author's name as a path parameter in the GET request.

Lombok for Streamlined Development:

    This application leverages Lombok, a popular Java library, to reduce boilerplate code. With Lombok, you can focus on writing clean, concise code without the need for repetitive getter and setter methods, toString(), equals(), and hashCode() implementations. This results in more readable and maintainable code, allowing developers to be more productive.

Usage:

    Bookstore owners and administrators can use this API to manage their book inventory efficiently.

    Developers can integrate this API into their applications to enable book-related functionalities, such as searching for books by author or updating book details.

Technology Stack:

    Java with Spring Boot: The application is built using Java and the Spring Boot framework for rapid development.

    Spring Data JPA: Spring Data JPA simplifies database interactions, making it easier to perform CRUD operations.

    Lombok: Lombok eliminates boilerplate code, improving code readability and developer productivity.

How to Get Started:

    To use the API, you can run it locally or deploy it to a server. Make sure to adjust the URL accordingly when making requests.

    Use tools like curl or API development environments (e.g., Postman or Insomnia) to interact with the API using the provided endpoints.

    Refer to the API documentation or the source code for more details on available endpoints and request/response formats.

The Book Management RESTful API is a versatile and efficient tool for managing and accessing book information. Whether you're a book enthusiast, a bookstore owner, or a developer building book-related applications, this API simplifies the process of working with book data, thanks to the power of Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and Lombok.
